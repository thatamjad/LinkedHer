Okay, I will generate a detailed phase-wise implementation plan for your MERN stack web application. This plan will build upon the features and architecture described in the `outline.md` file, incorporating your requested changes.

**Project Title:** "AuraConnect" (Suggesting a name that evokes a sense of community and distinct identity) - *You can, of course, choose any name you prefer.*

**Overall Project Goal:** To create a secure, women-only MERN stack social media application with dual modes: a Professional Networking mode (text/image posts, verified identity) and an X-style Anonymous Mode (text/image/video posts, untraceable cryptographic personas). The platform will include robust user verification, a job board populated by web scraping, and a comprehensive reporting system.
